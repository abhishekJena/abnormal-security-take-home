Created with CodeSandbox

## Setup

### To run the app
You'll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it's not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

```sh
cd <project_folder>
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### To run the tests

```sh
npm test
```
